<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][image1]

### Project Description

The world we live in today is a world of big data and people have trouble finding meaningful patterns within the expanse of information we mine, collect and store. Therefore, as a data driven developer, I have taken over the role of implementing a real-world data driven web application using a Solar System API. Within the web application I utilised Charts.js, implemented my own unique form of data visualisation which relates to the theme of the data set and used REACT to construct my front end.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Charts.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js-v2)
